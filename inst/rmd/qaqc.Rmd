# {.tabset}

This is an auto-generated report assessing the compatibility of the `r filename` data set with the AAE database. The submitted file includes `r nrow(data)` rows of data.

## Input fields

There were `r ncol(data)` fields in the submitted data set. `r sum(fields$matched)` of these fields matched known fields in the AAE database. The remaining `r sum(fields$unmatched)` fields had no known match, although partial matches were available for `r sum(unmatched$did_you_mean != "<None available>")` of these fields.

```{r input-fields, echo=FALSE}
# grab relevant columns from fields checks
all_fields <- fields %>%
  select(xlsx_fields, matched, out_col) %>%
  left_join(required %>% select(xlsx_fields, required), by = "xlsx_fields") %>%
  left_join(unmatched %>% select(xlsx_fields, did_you_mean), by = "xlsx_fields")

# format columns so they print nicely
all_fields <- all_fields %>%
  mutate(
    matched = ifelse(matched, "Yes", "No"),
    out_col = ifelse(required, paste0("**", out_col, "**"), out_col),
    out_col = ifelse(is.na(out_col) | out_col == "**NA**", "", out_col),
    out_col = ifelse(out_col == "" & matched == "Yes", xlsx_fields, out_col),
    did_you_mean = ifelse(is.na(did_you_mean), "", did_you_mean)
  ) %>%
  select(-required)
    
# print pretty table
kable(
  all_fields,
  caption = "Fields included in input file and matched fields in the AAEDB. Where an input field was not recognised, suggested matches are listed in the right-hand column.",
  col.names = c("Input field", "Match found?", "Matched field", "Possible matches")
)
```


## Recommended fields

Several fields are recommended for AAEDB uploads. The input data set was missing `r sum(required$missing_required)` of these fields. These fields should be treated as requirements unless they are not relevant to a specific field method (e.g., netting information is not required if netting was not used).

```{r required-fields, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
missing <- missing_fields(required, standards_link)
cat(colourise(missing$message, colour = missing$colour))
```

```{r list-required-fields, echo=FALSE} 
# pull out a subset of info and format it so it prints neatly
all_required <- required %>% 
  select(info_group, fields, xlsx_fields) %>%
  mutate(xlsx_fields = ifelse(is.na(xlsx_fields), "", xlsx_fields))

# count the total number of matches per required column
matches <- all_required %>%
  select(fields, xlsx_fields) %>%
  group_by(fields) %>%
  summarise(count = ifelse(all(xlsx_fields == ""), 0, length(xlsx_fields)))

# add this info to the table
all_required <- all_required %>% 
  left_join(matches, by = "fields")

# print a pretty table
kable(
  all_required,
  caption = "List of required fields for AAEDB uploads. Required fields not found in the input are shown in bold.",
  col.names = c("Information group", "Required columns", "Matched input columns", "Number of matches in input")
)
```


## Data QA

This section reports on all columns in the input data set that match to a [**standardised AAE column name**](`r standards_link`). All data fields are checked for missing or unexpected values and site descriptions are checked for duplicate or repeated values. There were `r sum(sapply(qaqc, function(x) x$errors))` data fields containing potential errors.

```{r validate, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
for (i in seq_along(qaqc)) {
  cat(colourise(qaqc[[i]]$message$message, qaqc[[i]]$message$colour))
  tables <- qaqc[[i]][c("missing", "invalid", "unexpected")]
  tables <- tables[!sapply(tables, is.null)]
  for (j in seq_along(tables)) {
    if (ncol(tables[[j]]) == 1)
      colnames(tables[[j]]) <- "Value"
    if (ncol(tables[[j]]) == 2)
      colnames(tables[[j]]) <- c("Value", "Count")
    print(kable(tables[[j]]))
  }
}
cat(colourise(duplicates$message$message, duplicates$message$colour))
```


## Data summaries

Several fields require manual checking to ensure that included values are correct. This section lists all unique records of waterbody, survey date, gear type, and coordinates. Please check these values and ensure they are consistent with the relevant field survey program.

```{r print-summaries, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
# field summaries
for (i in seq_along(field_summary)) {
  
  cat(paste0("\n\n### ", paste0(field_summary[[i]]$field, collapse = " and "), "\n\n"))

  cat(colourise(field_summary[[i]]$message$message, field_summary[[i]]$colour))
  print(
    kable(
      field_summary[[i]]$table,
      caption = paste0("List of all unique values of ", paste0(field_summary[[i]]$field, collapse = " and "), ". NA values indicate missing or incorrectly formatted values in the input data set (e.g., characters mixed with numbers, unrecognised symbols).")
    )
  )
  cat("\n")
  cat("\n\n ---- \n\n")
}
```

## Species list

The species field needs to include VBA accepted scientific names. Please ensure that any unmatched names are corrected, and provide scientific names if common names are detected.

```{r species-summary, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
# print list of species if required
if (!is.null(spp_sciname)) {
  colnames(spp_sciname)[1:4] <- c("Input species", "VBA scientific name", "VBA common name", "Possible matches")
  print(kable(
    spp_sciname,
    caption = "All species included in input data set with matched names from the VBA database where possible. Where no match is found, possible alternatives are suggested if a similar name exists in the VBA database."
  )
        )
  cat("\n")
  cat("\n\n ---- \n\n")
}

# and print match common names if these were provided instead of scientific names
if (!is.null(spp_common)) {
  cat(colourise(paste0(
    "It looks like species includes common names. ",
    "These have been matched to VBA names here but uploaded data sets ",
    "should fill the species field with scientific names."
  ),
  "red"
  ))
  colnames(spp_common)[1:4] <- c("Input species", "VBA scientific name", "VBA common name", "Possible matches")
  print(kable(
    spp_common,
    caption = "All species included in input data set with matched names from the VBA database where possible. Where no match is found, possible alternatives are suggested if a similar name exists in the VBA database."
  )
        )
  cat("\n")
  cat("\n\n ---- \n\n")
}
```

## Length and weight measurements

Please check length and weight measurements to ensure that values appear correct for each species. In particular, check that values are consistent with expected sizes (in mm for lengths and g for weight) and ensure that lengths for species with forked tails are recorded correctly in the fork_length field. Note that a blank entry in the "Group" (species) column may indicate one or more white spaces in the species field but the species column should be entered as "No fish" in these instances.

If lengths and weights are included, these are plotted below, along with Fulton's K estimates. These plots can be used to diagnose errors in units (e.g. lengths recorded in cm or weights recorded in kg). Typical Fulton's K values range from 0.5 to 1.5, with values > 5 likely resulting from an error in the data.

```{r measurement-check, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
# size measurements
for (i in seq_along(measurement_summary)) {
  
  cat(paste0("\n\n### ", measurement_summary[[i]]$field, "\n\n"))

  # filter out missing or nan values
  measurement_summary[[i]]$table <- measurement_summary[[i]]$table %>%
    filter(
      across(1, ~ !grepl("No fish", .x, ignore.case = TRUE)),
      across(2, ~ !(is.infinite(.x) | is.na(.x)))
    )
  
  # print a neat table listing min/max of these values
  cat(colourise(measurement_summary[[i]]$message$message, measurement_summary[[i]]$colour))
  print(kable(measurement_summary[[i]]$table,
              col.names = c(
                "Group",
                paste0(measurement_summary[[i]]$field, " (minimum value)"),
                paste0(measurement_summary[[i]]$field, " (median)"),
                paste0(measurement_summary[[i]]$field, " (mean)"),
                paste0(measurement_summary[[i]]$field, " (maximum value)")
              )
  ))
  cat("\n")
  cat("\n\n ---- \n\n")
  
  # pull out data for a single variable
  data_sub <- measurement_summary[[i]]$data
  
  # filter out species with 0 or 1 observations (if
  #   species are included)

      summarise(count = n())
    data_sub <- data_sub %>%
